## Why ConfisionJs?

JavaScript code running in the browser is visible to anybody who wishes to see it. This can sometimes pause a security threat to your application as people with malicious intent can steal or compromise your source code.<br>
ConfusionJs limits those threats by obfuscating the javascript code so that it becomes difficult to read or decipher.
consider the following script as example:

```js
(function(){
    alert("confuse the enemy!");
})();


```
In a normal setup, the code will just be delivered as is and anybody will be able to see the code.</br>
However, Confusionjs takes the raw code and obfuscates it into a more hard  to read and decipher syntax such as the one below:

```js
var _0x4f62 = [
    'FhxUT',
    'btlxw'
];
(function (_0x30ac87, _0x346513) {
    var _0x2f9996 = function (_0x360049) {
        while (--_0x360049) {
            _0x30ac87['push'](_0x30ac87['shift']());
        }
    };
    _0x2f9996(++_0x346513);
}(_0x4f62, 0x18f));
var _0x11b1 = function (_0x11e762, _0x3fac47) {
    _0x11e762 = _0x11e762 - 0x0;
    var _0x58af7a = _0x4f62[_0x11e762];
    return _0x58af7a;
};
(function () {
    var _0x178c8d = {
        'btlxw': function (_0x110a9e, _0x35231c) {
            return _0x110a9e(_0x35231c);
        },
        'FhxUT': 'hit'
    };
    _0x178c8d[_0x11b1('0x0')](alert, _0x178c8d[_0x11b1('0x1')]);
}());


```
## options
The following options are currently accepted when instantiating confusionjs:

 * root : A string. this represents the root of your static or public folder e.g "./static" or "./public"
 
 * store: A string. a folder where to store the obfuscated  javascript files
 
 * cache: A boolean. determines wether or not confusionjs should create a new confused file everytime a js file is requested
 
 * debug: A boolean. wether to log to console any debug information e.g when a  file is cahed or served from cache
